all explanation
I’ll explain each command you ran, what it does, why errors came, and why it finally worked — step-by-step, exam / viva ready.

🔁 FULL EXPLANATION OF WHAT HAPPENED
1️⃣ gitinit ❌
gitinit


Error: command not found

❌ Why?

gitinit is not a Git command

✅ Correct command:
git init

2️⃣ git init ✅
git init


Output:

Initialized empty Git repository...

✅ What it does:

Creates a .git folder

Converts your folder into a Git repository

Default branch created: master

3️⃣ git add demo.txt ✅
git add demo.txt

✅ What it does:

Moves demo.txt to staging area

Tells Git: “Track this file for the next commit”

4️⃣ git commit demo.txt ❌
git commit demo.txt

❌ Why error?
Aborting commit due to empty commit message

❌ Reason:

git commit does not take file name

Git needs a commit message

5️⃣ git commit -m ❌
git commit -m

❌ Why error?
switch `m` requires a value

❌ Reason:

-m must be followed by a message

6️⃣ git commit -m "add demo file" ✅
git commit -m "add demo file"

✅ What it does:

Creates a commit

Saves snapshot of staged files

Commit ID created: a050e1b

root-commit → first commit in repo

7️⃣ Pasting GitHub URL alone ❌
https://github.com/Tanish7788/Capgemini-Training7799.git

❌ Why error?

Terminal thinks it’s a command

URLs must be used with Git commands

8️⃣ git remote-v ❌
git remote-v

❌ Why error?

Missing space

✅ Correct:
git remote -v

9️⃣ git remote -v ✅
git remote -v

✅ Output:

(empty)

✅ Meaning:

No remote repository connected yet

🔟 git branch -M main ✅
git branch -M main

✅ What it does:

Renames branch from master → main

-M = force rename

1️⃣1️⃣ pit push ❌
pit push -u origin main

❌ Why error?

Typo → pit instead of git

1️⃣2️⃣ git remote add origin ... ✅
git remote add origin https://github.com/Tanish7788/Capgemini-Training7799

✅ What it does:

Connects local repo to GitHub repo

origin = nickname of remote URL

1️⃣3️⃣ git push origin main ❌ (First time)
git push origin main

❌ Error:
Permission denied to Tanish888

❌ Reason:

GitHub account used: Tanish888

Repo owner: Tanish7788

No permission → 403 Forbidden

1️⃣4️⃣ Second push error ❌
Invalid username or token
Password authentication is not supported

❌ Reason:

GitHub no longer allows password

Requires Personal Access Token (PAT)

1️⃣5️⃣ Wrong git remote set-url usage ❌
git remote ^[[200~git remote set-url origin <NEW_URL>

❌ Reason:

Accidentally pasted placeholder text

<NEW_URL> is not a real command

1️⃣6️⃣ Correct git remote set-url ✅
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Tanish7788/Capgemini-Training7799

✅ What it does:

Updates remote URL

Forces Git to re-authenticate

1️⃣7️⃣ git push origin main ✅ (SUCCESS)
git push origin main

🎉 What happened:
Writing objects...
[new branch] main -> main

✅ Meaning:

Authentication succeeded

Commit pushed to GitHub

Local main → Remote main

🧠 VIVA / INTERVIEW SUMMARY (IMPORTANT)
🔹 git init

Initializes a new Git repository.

🔹 git add

Adds files to staging area.

🔹 git commit -m

Saves staged changes with a message.

🔹 git branch -M main

Renames current branch to main.

🔹 git remote add origin

Links local repo to remote repository.

🔹 git push origin main

Uploads local commits to GitHub.

🔹 Error 403

Occurs due to wrong GitHub account or missing permission.

✅ FINAL STATE

✔ Local repo created
✔ File committed
✔ Branch renamed
✔ Remote connected
✔ Authentication fixed
✔ Code successfully pushed 🎉




now i ahve made changes in the demo folder i have uploaded how can i kniow if changes made have been uploaded and what what changes are made

Perfect question — this is core Git understanding 👍
I’ll explain exactly how to know:

What changes you made locally

Whether those changes are uploaded to GitHub

What commands show what

🧠 1️⃣ See WHAT changes you made (local)
🔹 Check file status
git status


Possible outputs:

✅ If you see:
modified: demo.txt


👉 File changed but NOT uploaded yet

✅ If you see:
nothing to commit, working tree clean


👉 No pending local changes

🔹 See exact changes (line by line)
git diff


📌 Shows:

- removed lines

+ added lines

Example:

- Hello
+ Hello Git

🧠 2️⃣ Check what is READY to be uploaded
🔹 After staging
git add demo.txt


Check:

git status


You’ll see:

Changes to be committed:
  modified: demo.txt

🔹 See staged changes only
git diff --staged

🧠 3️⃣ Check what HAS ALREADY been uploaded
🔹 View commit history
git log --oneline


Example:

a050e1b add demo file


If you made a new commit, it will appear here.

🔍 Check if local and GitHub are in sync
git status


If you see:

Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'


👉 ✅ Changes are uploaded

If you see:

Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit


👉 ❌ Not uploaded yet

🧠 4️⃣ See what changes were uploaded to GitHub
🔹 Compare local vs remote
git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline


Shows commits not yet pushed

🔹 See last uploaded commit details
git show

🧠 5️⃣ Confirm on GitHub (visual check)

Open your GitHub repo in browser

Go to Commits

Click latest commit

GitHub shows:

Files changed

Lines added/removed

🚀 6️⃣ Upload your new changes (complete flow)
git status
git diff
git add demo.txt
git commit -m "updated demo file"
git push origin main

📌 One-line VIVA answer

git status shows whether changes are staged or committed, git diff shows what changes were made, and git log shows whether changes have been pushed to the remote repository.

If you want, tell me:

You changed which file(s)?

Folder or multiple files?

I’ll give you the exact commands for your case 👌

$ git status
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   demo.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

91987@TANISH_VICTUS MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Capgemini (main)

Perfect 👍
Your git status output is very clear. Let me explain exactly what it means and what to do next.

🧠 What your current status means
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
        modified: demo.txt

🔍 Interpretation

You edited demo.txt

Git has detected the change

❌ The change is NOT staged

❌ The change is NOT committed

❌ The change is NOT uploaded to GitHub

Right now the change exists only on your local system.

🔎 See exactly WHAT you changed (recommended)
git diff


This will show:

Lines added (+)

Lines removed (-)

✅ To upload these changes to GitHub (step-by-step)
1️⃣ Stage the file
git add demo.txt

2️⃣ Confirm it’s staged
git status


You should now see:

Changes to be committed:
        modified: demo.txt

3️⃣ Commit the change
git commit -m "updated demo.txt"

4️⃣ Push to GitHub
git push origin main

🔍 After pushing, confirm upload
Locally
git status


You should see:

nothing to commit, working tree clean
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'

On GitHub

Open repository

Go to Commits

See latest commit message: updated demo.txt

🧠 Viva-ready explanation

The file demo.txt is modified in the working directory but not staged. After staging with git add, committing with git commit, and pushing with git push, the changes will be uploaded to the remote repository.

🚦 If you want to discard changes instead (not upload)
git restore demo.txt


⚠️ This will undo your edits.

You’re doing great 👍
